# BinRex

just a bunch of random stuff i built to learn coding and honestly just mess around. made this package manager thing because typing the same commands over and over in every new VM was getting annoying. yeah [Hecate](https://github.com/Nurysso/hecate) is my hyprland dotfiles but like... i'm not installing that whole setup in a VM lol. and if i'm on windows or some other distro? totally useless.

so binrex exists now.

## what even is this

basically a package manager but make it simple. works on any OS as long as you got git and whatever dependencies the tool needs (check the manifest.json). git-based, builds from source, does the job.

keeps my old code from rotting away in forgotten repos, plus i actually use some of this stuff regularly.

## what's in here

- **websii** - web server that shows your files in a browser, hot reloads when stuff changes
- **file_convert** - Shell script that just wraps ffmpeg to convert files
- **xtrat** - Extracts compressed files. all types. you know the drill.
- **vanish** - rm but with cache, has a TUI you can customize
- **tyr** - Uses ML to organize your files (because why not) build in rust lets GOOOO...
- **sUpd** - Updates your system(no matter the distro).

## why tho

because i needed my tools everywhere without the hassle. simple as that.
